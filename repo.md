# Lab Reflection Report

In this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control and managing projects efficiently. I practiced creating and tracking files, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub. One of the most useful things I learned was how branches work and how they allow us to experiment without affecting the main project. I also learned how to merge branches and resolve issues when working with remote repositories. Overall, this lab helped me understand the basic workflow of Git and improved my confidence in using GitHub for project management.
